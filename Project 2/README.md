## How does it work?

Variables: X__R_T_P, A__R_T and Y__TC_P

- The variable X is the task for a runner "R" at the position "P" at time "T".

- The variable A is the activity of a runner "R" at time "T". If he is active or not.

- The variable Y represents when a product P arrives at the packaging area at time TC (TC=T+C, time when it's placed on the conveyor + time to arrives).

## Importants aspects of this project:

    - (1): We have to make sure that two runners are not at the same position at time t.
  
    - (2): We also have to check that a runner doesn't have a task between two tasks. If he is running from position p at time t to position q, he can't be at any position between t and t+t_pq.
    
    - (3): If a runner is at position p he can't be at position q at the same time t.
    
    - (4): We have to make sure that every runners stay active without taking any pauses. It means that a runner must move to another position or he becomes inactive.
    
    - (5): If we have a runner inactive at time t it implies that he is inactive at t+1.
    
    - (6): All runners must have a timespan of at least 50% of the maximum. So, for a runner active at time t, all others runners must be active at t/2.
    
    - (7): We have to check that a runner was at position p at time t-c_p when a product p arrives at the packaging area at time t.
    
    - (8): All products must arrive at the packaging area.

## Complexity


## TO DO:
- check si ya pas d'erreur
- qu'il manque pas de clauses avec Y car c'est bizarre, j'ai limpression c'est jamais déposé
